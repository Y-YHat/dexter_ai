            "\n",
            "I've heard people talk about Paris being the city of love and there's the Eiffel Tower there. Also, major government institutions are probably located in the capital. France's government... does the president live in Paris? I think the presidential palace is there. Also, when I think of French landmarks, the Louvre Museum is in Paris, and maybe the National Assembly. That adds up. \n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, sometimes countries change their capitals. Has France ever changed theirs? I know some countries have moved capitals, like Brazil moved to Brasília. But for France, I don't recall any such change. It's been Paris for a long time. Let me cross-check with historical knowledge. During World War II, when Germany occupied France, the Vichy regime was in control, but I think Paris remained the capital, though the government was based in Vichy temporarily. But post-war, it reverted back. So Paris is the traditional and current capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, in terms of geography, Paris is centrally located in the northern part of France, which makes sense for a capital city. It's a hub for transportation, culture, and economy. The question is straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing up any details. Maybe some people confuse other cities like Lyon or Marseille, but those are just other major cities, not the capital. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Paris. No need to overcomplicate. Just to be thorough, maybe I can think of other sources: in textbooks, Paris is always cited as the capital. Also, in international events like the Olympics, Paris has hosted them, which capitals often do. So all signs point to Paris.\n",
            "Final Answer: The capital of France is **Paris**. Known for its rich history, iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris has long been the political, cultural, and economic heart of France. It houses key government institutions, including the official residence of the President (Élysée Palace) and the French Parliament.\n"

            "Final Answer: (\"Okay, so the question is asking for the capital of France. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. France is a country in Europe, right? I remember that Paris is a major city there. But wait, is Paris actually the capital? Let me think.\\n\\nI've heard people talk about Paris being the city of love and there's the Eiffel Tower there. Also, major government institutions are probably located in the capital. France's government... does the president live in Paris? I think the presidential palace is there. Also, when I think of French landmarks, the Louvre Museum is in Paris, and maybe the National Assembly. That adds up. \\n\\nBut wait, sometimes countries change their capitals. Has France ever changed theirs? I know some countries have moved capitals, like Brazil moved to Brasília. But for France, I don't recall any such change. It's been Paris for a long time. Let me cross-check with historical knowledge. During World War II, when Germany occupied France, the Vichy regime was in control, but I think Paris remained the capital, though the government was based in Vichy temporarily. But post-war, it reverted back. So Paris is the traditional and current capital.\\n\\nAlso, in terms of geography, Paris is centrally located in the northern part of France, which makes sense for a capital city. It's a hub for transportation, culture, and economy. The question is straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing up any details. Maybe some people confuse other cities like Lyon or Marseille, but those are just other major cities, not the capital. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Paris. No need to overcomplicate. Just to be thorough, maybe I can think of other sources: in textbooks, Paris is always cited as the capital. Also, in international events like the Olympics, Paris has hosted them, which capitals often do. So all signs point to Paris.\", \"The capital of France is Paris. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Identify the Country**: France is a country located in Western Europe.\\n2. **Understand Capitals**: A capital city typically houses the government's main offices and institutions.\\n3. **Recall Major Cities**: Paris is the most well-known city in France, recognized for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.\\n4. **Government Affiliation**: Key government structures, such as the French President's residence (Élysée Palace) and Parliament, are situated in Paris.\\n5. **Historical Context**: Paris has been France's historic and cultural center for centuries, including during events like the French Revolution.\\n6. **Eliminate Alternatives**: Other major cities (e.g., Lyon, Marseille) are significant but not political capitals.\\n7. **Confirm Consistency**: France has not changed its capital in modern history, solidifying Paris's status.\\n\\n**Answer**: Paris.\")\n"
